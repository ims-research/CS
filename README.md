Context Server written in C# for SIP / IMS.

This project forms part of a larger investigation into Dynamic Service Orchestration in the IP Multimedia Subsystem.

In this framework, the Context Server (CS) is used to gather information about the end user. It is the single point of contact for the rest of the framework to receive contextual information about the end user. The CS gathers information from a variety of sources and amalgamates it for transfer to the Service Capability Interaction Manager (SCIM).

Currently presence / status is implemented as a proof of concept.

There is no documentation at the moment. Please leave some feedback if you are interested in the project.
